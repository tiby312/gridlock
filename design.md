realtime not turn-based
leverage existing broccoli project and seq_impulse projects
more complicated and thus more unique and harder to replicate
mesmerizing to see many bots interact and act autonomously

rogue-like
want to make one playthrough not take too long.
want some kind of scoring mechanism so friends can compete
survival aspect? tower defense?


no competative multiplayer
realtime+competative multiplayer=mad clicks and frenzied apm. Not desireable.
aiming for a more relaxed feel.
